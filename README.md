Tetris
======

Replica of the classic Tetris in Java using <a href="http://slick.ninjacave.com/">Slick2D</a>.<br />

"Slick2D is an easy to use set of tools and utilites wrapped around LWJGL OpenGL bindings to make 2D Java game development easier."<br />
Slick2D's "Getting Started" <a href="http://slick.ninjacave.com/wiki/index.php?title=Setting_up_Slick2D_with_NetBeansIDE">page.

All files required to run the game can be found in Tetris.zip (execute the JAR)<br />
Various Tetris drawings and colors can be found in Tetris.xlsx<br />
If using Netbeans in Windows, after each "Clean and Build," run make.bat to automatically generate the Tetris.zip archive (you do not have to delete the pre-existing Tetris.zip archive)

Game instructions/controls can be found within the game itself.<br />
Music was downloaded from <a href="https://archive.org/details/TetrisThemeMusic">this page</a>.<br />
Block textures were created using <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP 2</a>.

Notes:
- After clearing several rows, the game enters the next level!
- With each level, the lock cycle becomes faster and faster.
- Leveling and scoring constants can be modified simply.
